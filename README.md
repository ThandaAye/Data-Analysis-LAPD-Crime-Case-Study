Data Analysis LAPD Crime Case Study using Python

### Data Cleaning  
Prepare the dataset for analysis by resolving common data quality issues.  
- Identify and handle missing values  
- Remove or review duplicates and inconsistencies  
- Ensure correct data types  
- Normalize inconsistent categorical values  

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
Explore and understand the structure, trends, and relationships in the data.  
- Perform required operations to bring in extra info from the provided crime and weapon lookup files  
- Generate summary statistics  
- Visualize distributions and correlations  
- Analyze time- and location-based patterns  
- Explore solve rate by various features  

### Feature Engineering  
Create or refine features to enhance model quality.  
- Transform or derive features  
- Encode categorical variables  
- Normalize or scale features as appropriate  

### Model Building  
Build classification models to predict whether a case will be solved.  
- Use at least two models (such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest)  
- Perform a proper train-test split  
- Apply appropriate preprocessing (e.g., scaling, encoding)  
- Tune hyperparameters if needed  

### Model Evaluation  
Evaluate how well your models perform.  
- Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC  
- You can include confusion matrices and interpret results  
- Discuss the effect of class imbalance and possible mitigation  
- Compare model performance meaningfully  

### Visualization  
Use effective visuals to support your analysis.  
- Include charts such as bar plots, feature importance, and heatmaps  
- Make all visualizations interpretable and relevant  
- Label axes, legends, and titles clearly  

### Insights, Interpretation, and Reporting  
Communicate your findings clearly, professionally, and meaningfully.  
- Include an executive summary outlining key findings and recommendations  
- Clearly explain what factors most influence case solvability  
- Highlight any spatial, temporal, or demographic patterns  
- Suggest improvements or interventions based on your results  
- Reflect on limitations of your analysis and model  
- Structure your report into logical, readable sections with explanations
